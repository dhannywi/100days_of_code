        The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. 
        The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
        It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.
