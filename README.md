# 100days of Python
Compilation of python codes from my 100 days of Python exercises

One of my New Year's resolution  was that I wanted to be a bettter Python programmer. I will be adding into this repository my programming exercises to document my journey. My hope is that by the end of this challenge I have a solid understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms using Python and is able to optimize and debug my code efficiently.
